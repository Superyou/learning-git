# Neural Network 
## Redundancy

#### How to reduce redundancy?

* Model size — reduce connection & fine-tune  training   

* Quantization — reduce the weight storage  

* Computation — new calculating strategy to reduce complexity 

* Storage 

 1. feature maps 

   Conv - Pooling - Relu — SNAPEA, decoding strategy based on RELU property 
   
 2. weight matrix 
  
   CirCNN , Clustering & quantization
